                    <p> My practice this week:
                        <br>Time: 10 hours
                        <br>Topic: Content and Pages
                        <br>Proof: This week was very hectic, I had a lot of work that needed to be done on my site.
                        I worked a lot on my site plan and making sure that my site was setup according to the site plan. I also spent a lot of time
                        researching responsiveness and how to make my site work on mobile devices and other formats. I have some more work on that
                        but hopefully I will be able to get it done in time.
