                    <p> My practice this week:
                        <br>Time: 4 hours
                        <br>Topic: CSS styling and research.
                        <br>Proof: This week was mostly spent researching different CSS styling and what are the different ways to 
                        put cool things into my website. I will send the professor an email asking about how to get my footer setup correctly.
                        after that I think I will have a pretty good base of where I want my site to go.
