                    <p> My practice this week:
                        <br>Time: 4 hours
                        <br>Topic: Images and audio data.
                        <br>Proof: I have added some images and audio data to my sites. I also have added a contact us page.
                        I have worked on adding a couple of different pages. I hope that I have everything setup for the conclusion of this module.
