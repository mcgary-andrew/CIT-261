            Our daughter is 4 years old and our son is 1 1/2 years old. Our daughter loves to mess around and doesn't ever seem to stop moving. 
            She is in pre-school right now, and loves it. She is also doing dance at her school. She is very excited for her presentations coming up.
        </p>

            Our son is just a happy little boy.
