                <p><b>Where:</b> I will be doing my work either at work during my lunch or any downtime, or late at night in my basement. This will be good because at work, I will be able to ask my co-workers for help, since I work at a software company, I am sure they will be a very good resource. At night in my basement will be good because it is quite and no one is down there.</p>
                <p><b>When:</b> My schedule will be every day during lunch and then whatever else I do not get done I will do at home after 10pm, which is when the rest of my family will be asleep.</p>
                <p><b>How:</b> I will do the reading while I have my project up and work on it as I go through the reading.</p>
                <p><b>Who:</b> I have a couple of go to people that I can contact to help. They will be my co-workers, they are software engineers and I am sure they will have the knowledge to help me.</p>
