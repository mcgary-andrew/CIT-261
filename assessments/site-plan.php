                <p>My site name is www.mcgaryfamily.com. I hope to be able to make it so it requires a username and password to get in.
                The purpose of this site is to give a basic background of me and my family including 
                activities, achievements and other info. I also plan to have pages dedicated to my wife's creations and hopefully be able to 
                create a way for her to sell some of her creations.</p>
                <p>My target audience is primarily my family and other relatives. For example, an audience member could be a lady in her mid to late 30s with 4 kids and loves to know about what is going on in my family.
                Another audience member could be an older man (grandpa type) who is retired and would like to see what my family and I have achieved. An 
                audience member could be someone who wants to look at my wife's creations. They will be directed to her creations page which will 
                also give them the ability to purchase her creations.</p>
                <p>They could come to my site if they have a question regarding what my family did this past weekend, what grade my kids are in,
                or what we aspire to do later in life. Also, if they are interested in the baby items my wife creates. If they are looking to purchase, or 
                get ideas for things to create themselves.</p>

                    <li>Main page will give a brief introduction to the site and what it is there for, as well as links to the other pages within my site.</li>
                    <li>I will have an "About Us" page that will include a page for me, my wife, and my kids. Those pages will include our favorite song, 
                        sports team, movie, super hero, etc. Information about what we are doing and what our current goals are.</li>
                    <li>I will have galleries (implemented when login feature is setup) that will include pictures, videos, events and other notable items.</li>
                    <li>I also will have a calendar (implemented when login feature is setup) showing what events and activities we have planned.</li>
                    <li>Since my wife is very creative and likes to create things, I hope to have a page dedicated to her creations and a page where 
                    you will possibly be able to purchase some items. Also a page that will allow you to do custom orders.</li>
                    <li>Contact Us page will allow you to contact a member of the family.</li>
