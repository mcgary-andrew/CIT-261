                <p> This site is dedicated to my family. My wife, Wynter, and I were married and sealed on October 11th, 2008 in the Newport Beach Temple.
                    We were both born in Newport Beach, CA. Our families have known each other for a very long time, however, we did not meet until we found each other online. 
                    We have since had our first two kids, a girl and a boy. We recently went through a major life change in moving out of sunny southern California,
                to the cold, much more affordable, Utah. It has been a difficult move considering neither of us have family up here but we were able to buy a house
                which is the main reason why we moved.</p>
