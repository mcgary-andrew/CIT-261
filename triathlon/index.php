                This is a Triathlon like no other. You will travel through a picturesque scenery of San Francisco, 
                however, this is anything but the normal scene you usually see in San Francisco. There will be zombies at every corner.
                Not only will you be trying to escape from being put in either one of the jails you will be visiting but you also must 
                escape from the zombies chasing you. Not only will they be chasing you on your 16 mile run, they will also be in the water for your
                swim to Alcatraz Island and during your 25 mile bike ride, which will require you to weave your way in and out of them.
                <br><br>You will have zombies during all legs of the race, and there are penalties if you are caught or bitten. Details on individual 
                route page.<br><br>After the Race please join us for the many activities, food and fun:
